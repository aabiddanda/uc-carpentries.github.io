# Workshop Development Checklist

This workshop development checklist is meant to provide a reasonable way to get setup with the organization behind the workshop. The tutorial below assumes that you are a member of the UC Carpentries Club and have access to the relevant accounts. The tutorial also assumes that you are the lead instructor for the workshop, and have been requested to run a workshop via the [request form](https://test.com)

# 1. Find a location for your workshop   

One of the most critical ingredients for a good Software Carpentry Workshop is finding a space that has the following:
  
  - Enough space for everyone and their chairs
  - A projector and screen 
  - Reasonable distribution of power outlets for chargers (although extension cords can help)

There are a couple of nice spaces on the UChicago Campus that many of us have taught in before that are worth reaching out to:
  
  - [Computational Sciences Instructional Labaratory]() 
  - Stuart 101
 
Once you have a confirmation that you have the space secured for the dates of your workshop, you can move on to the other steps  

# 2. Generate a workshop website 

The primary front-facing portion of the workshop is the workshop website. The workshop [website template template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template) is hosted by the Carpentries on their Github page. In order to use their template you need to go through the following steps listed in the `README.md` file of the template repository. 

When customizing your workshop website, please use the [directions from the Carpentries](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/customization/index.html)

A couple of things to keep in mind when importing the repository for your own workshop.

- Make sure that you are logged into the appropriate github account. When conducting a workshop through the UC-Carpentries Club, please use the `uc-carpentries` github.
- The imported URL should have the format `YYYY-MM-DD-site`. If you are hosting a workshop for a particular organization, make sure that `site` designates that organization (e.g. `BSD`, `UChicagoConsortium`, etc)

# 3. Officially register your workshop with the Carpentries

In order to have the workshop listed on the official Carpentries webpage, it needs to be appropriately registered. You can [register your workshop at this link](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/) after creating your website

# 4. Generate an Eventbrite for your workshop
