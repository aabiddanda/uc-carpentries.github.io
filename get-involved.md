## Becoming A Certified Carpentries Instructor

There are [many reasons](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/for_instructors/new_instructors.html#motivation-for-people-to-train-as-instructors) why you might want to become a certified Carpentries instructor, including gaining practice teaching, sharing useful skills with others, and making the world a better place.

We encourage you to first attend or help out with one of our workshops to see how they are taught. You may also submit a request to go through instructor training online through the [Become an Instructor](https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/) official page (not affiliated with UChicago). Note: we are working on bringing an on-campus instructor training to campus by September 2020.
